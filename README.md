### React Primitives Calendar
Calendar POC built using react-primitives for [Triangle Modern Web Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/trianglemodernweb/events/241799844/)

### Getting started
* clone repo
* `yarn` or `npm install`
* Running
  * web: `yarn storybook:web` or `npm run storybook:web`
  * react-native: `yarn storybook:rn` or `npm run storybook:rn`
  * both: `yarn storybook`

### Future of project.
Currently there are no plans to add more to this project. In the future the most likely path would be to fork airbnb/react-dates and replace the DOM components with primitives.
